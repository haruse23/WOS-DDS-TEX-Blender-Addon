Both files are needed (and they have to be in same folder) for the conversion from TEX to DDS.

As for *.dds files, no renaming is required to convert from DDS to TEX.

To convert from DDS to TEX, just drag and drop a DDS file.

To convert from TEX to DDS, just drag and drop a *.0.tex0 file or a *.0.tex1 file.

Converted files will be created in same folder as the file you drag and drop.
