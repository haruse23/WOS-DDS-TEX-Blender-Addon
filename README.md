# WOS-DDS-TEX-Blender-Addon
Convert from Spider-Man: Web of Shadows's TEX format to DDS and vice versa.

# Important
This add-on is designed on Blender 4.5.0

If you have *.0.tex file rename it to *.0.tex0

If you have *.1.tex file rename it to *.0.tex1

Both files are needed (and they have to be in same folder) for the conversion from TEX to DDS.

As for *.dds files, no renaming is required to convert from DDS to TEX.

To convert from DDS to TEX, just drag and drop a DDS file.

To convert from TEX to DDS, just drag and drop a *.0.tex0 file or a *.0.tex1 file.

Converted files will be created in same folder as the file you drag and drop.
